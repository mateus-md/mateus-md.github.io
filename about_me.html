                Hello! I'm Mateus M. D. Souza. I'm a autistic brazilian artist, programmer and freelancer translator.
                I live in Paran√°, Brazil and I'm currently looking for translation jobs, be games' localization or literature books' translation.

                I'm a freelancer translator, that means you can hire me to translate your texts/scripts/game dialogues from English and Spanish to Portuguese.
                My mother language is Portuguese, but I speak English pretty well (despite my ADHD keeping me from writing correctly sometimes).
                I'm also learning Mandarin, German and Spanish by myself. The last one I have a intermediary degree, most because Spanish and Portuguese are quite similar.

                I make some sketches with <a href = "https://krita.org/en/" target = "_blank">Krita</a>. I use a wacom intuos cth 490 to draw.
                I also make pixel art using <a href = "https://www.aseprite.org/" target = "_blank">aseprite</a>.

                I program as a hobby and do not pretend to work with it.
                I mostly program(ed) in C and Lua, but I'm moving to <a href = "https://harelang.org/" target = "_blank">Hare</a> as my main language.

                You can find me on
                <a href = "https://twitter.com/levi_alfeuson" target = "_blank">Twitter</a>.
                It's mainly in Portuguese, so I don't think it's a good start to you if you don't know this language,
                but I also post some stuff there in english once in a while.

                I'm also a marxist-leninist, by the way. I'm (almost) a PCB militant, so if you are a big tech or something
                trying to hire me, be aware of that in the first place. It's not a threat, it's just a friendly warning.
