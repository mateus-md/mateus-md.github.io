                I'm Miko M. D. Souza. I'm a transfem brazilian writer and freelance translator. My pronouns are she/her and I didn't have transitioned (yet). Most because I still depend on tranphobic and homophobic friends and family members.
                This is a secret section of my blog. Not listed, so parents than don't even know what is github won't find it, but if I want to present myself, I can send this.

                I do freelance translations, so I can locate your texts/scripts/game dialogues from English or Spanish to Portuguese.
                My mother language is Portuguese, but I speak English pretty well (despite my ADHD keeping me from writing correctly sometimes).
                I'm also learning Mandarin, German and Spanish by myself. The last one I have a intermediary degree, most because Spanish and Portuguese are quite similar in its word roots and grammar.

                I make some sketches with <a href = "https://krita.org/en/" target = "_blank">Krita</a>. I use a wacom intuos cth 490 to draw.
                I also make pixel art using <a href = "https://www.aseprite.org/" target = "_blank">aseprite</a>.

                I program as a hobby and do not pretend to work with it.
                I mostly program(ed) in C and Lua, but I'm moving to <a href = "https://harelang.org/" target = "_blank">Hare</a> as my main language.

                <a href = "https://twitter.com/mikumikudice" target = "_blank">Twitter</a>.
                It's mainly in Portuguese, so I don't think it's a good start to you if you don't know this language,
                but I also post some stuff there in english once in a while.

                I'm also a marxist-leninist, by the way. I'm (almost) a PCB (The Brazilian Communist Party) militant, so if you are a big tech or something
                trying to hire me, be aware of that in the first place. It's not a threat, it's just a friendly warning.
