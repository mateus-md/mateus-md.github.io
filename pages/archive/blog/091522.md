## my midnight thoughts
today is a short post. i'm just officially announcing the new site page, mmdnight (a joke with mmd and midnight) that is basically a second feed of posts, but with only philosophical texts. a different vibe, though. no personal talking, no fonts, just thinking like a cleric or a german philosopher in 1730 (except for the nazi shit).

you can access it by the menu section on the top of the site or by __this link__. i hope you all enjoy.
p.s.: this page will also have a pt-br version of the texts. this will help me show my _translation skills_ for anyone interested in it.
