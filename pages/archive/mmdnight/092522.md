# the void of the loneliness
the void is not the panting sensation of drowning - that's despair; the calm that comes before the storm. no. void is deep in the ocean. so deep and sure of death that nothing matters anymore.

the void is silence. not the white noises that surround us at night, but the deafening silence that is the vastness of nothingness. the coolness of conformity and, to some extent, comfort of the embracing emptiness that deepens as we plunge into the dark and bitter ocean. the void is the rock bottom that we dig ourselves.

void is the deepest and most refined form of sadness. no longer surrounded by fear and uncertainty, or anger and nonconformity. no. the depressing and relentless final form of sadness is the void. be sure that nothing is sure. the abyss that separates us from the noisy world that surrounds us.now there is just silence; the complete missing of  everything and everyone. and it's not quiet because there is no noise; it's quiet because we hear nothing. not even ourselves. our fears and awes settle within us, giving space to the growing abyss inside our hearts.

loneliness is having the soul emptied of all its content, for only the echo of what once were there reverb in the blank space of our vile and tiny existence. the same existence that put us in this same void.
