# the value of missing the ones that are gone
the missing. that tight feeling in our chests. that tired mind moment on thinking that they are not here anymore. every memory brought back makes it harder to remember again. a small hole in our souls, that never fills up, but looks smaller at the pace we grow.

but this feeling -- this pain -- it's nothing but the remaining warm of the flame of the love we have for the person that's gone. a feeling that lasts. it doesn't change over time, just affects us differently. this feeling is the stony clause of the entanglement of our memories. the ones we lost are part of us, just like we made part of them.

and they never leave us. in every dream, in every keepsake, in every important date, they'll be there to visit us. even we not seeing or touching them. they live in our thoughts, and will never leave there. indisputably, part of our eternal spirits.

I would rather a hundred times to suffer by the loss of my mother everyday over forgetting how she was; of the feeling I had over her and her over me. the pain of loss is nothing but the pain of traveling to a distant place and not being able to stay as long as we wish. missing is love.
