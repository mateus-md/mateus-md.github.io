# the chain that makes us who we are
memory. memory is what makes us who we are. each souvenir is a link in the chain of our souls, a string in the fabric of our existence. memory is the mass which gives us shape. the metaphysical register that defines what you are.

with no memory, there are no learning; no experience; no life. what defines us as essence, what makes us special, is how we lived and passed trough the most adverse situations along our existences. memory is soul. the intrinsic information that is written in each atom that have once been part of us constitutes a endless network of relationships and experiences that never can be erased.
being as so, in the same way that other people are part of our memories, equally we are also part of their memories, and as such, our souls are forever linked. our essence gets mixed with with the one's that we share moments. our life is part of other's, and _vice-versa_. we all are one; we all are memory.
