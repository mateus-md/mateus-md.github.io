## some additional information about this site and me
I used the [ancient-scroll](https://lospec.com/palette-list/ancient-scroll) color palette created by [Dr_Succubus](https://lospec.com/drsuccubus) on this website.

this website was entirely build using the [elm](https://elm-lang.org) programming language.

all the source code for this website can be found in its [github repository](https://github.com/mikumikudice/mikumikudice.github.io) under the [BUNNYWARE license](https://mikumikudice.github.io/LICENSE).
