I used the [ancient-scroll](https://lospec.com/palette-list/ancient-scroll){:target="_blank"} color palette created by [Dr_Succubus](https://lospec.com/drsuccubus){:target="_blank"} on this website.

this website was entirely build using the [elm](https://elm-lang.org){:target="_blank"} programming language.
