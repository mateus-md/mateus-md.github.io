            <h3>B is for <b>B</b>etter</h3><p>Back then I was developing my own language, a VM powered, AOT compiled, embeddable programming language, <a href="blog/Lowy.html" target="_blank" >Lowy</a>. I tried to create a masterpiece. I still want to create this language, but a lot of things changed since then, including my view of things. Specially my way to understand and write code. To be honest, I was almost giving up the idea of giving life to Lowy. My life, with all my studies and school were eating all my time and my CPU usage (aka my mind). I came back to programming a few months ago, and now I'm here once again to say: "I'm doing something better and cooler than Lowy: B++".<br/><p>You can read further more about what is B++ at its <a href="https://github.com/mateus-md/beeplusplus" target="_blank" >github repository</a>, but in a nutshell, it's a revival of an old programming language, B, the mother of C. It's supposed to be retrocompatible, but we can't, once B was developed for the 36-bit mainframes, and nowadays we only use either 32 or 64 bits architectures, so it's kinda hard to do it. So, instead, I'm reimplementing it as if it has been developed today. So instead of 36-bit integers, there is 32-bit ones.<br/><p>Someone did something like that a few years ago, that was <a href="https://github.com/Leushenko/" target="_blank" >Leushenko</a>. But they did not <i>incremented</i> it, just reimplemented. I want to do so. Make what C# did to C++ to B.<br/><p>I loved B right when I heard about it. And I have a heavy and deep memory about it because in the same day I learned about my hero, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie" target="_blank" >Dennis Ritchie</a>. I wanted so much to meet him, but unfortunately, he passed away in 2011, when I was 8 years old. He's my hero because he's almost exactly what I want to be. He created things that I love, directly or indirectly, like C, Linux (linux does exit because of UNIX), for example. He went to college study Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics, exactly what I want to do too.<br/><p>I didn't meet he in life, so I don't know how he was as a person, as a friend, but I like to think about him as a good man. A really good man, and I'll believe so until the end. That's why I'm creating B++, to honor his memory and his work. To be a pupil of him. To be part of his history. I want to be like him (or even greater than him, if I can). I want to become the hero I think he is to my future children. A great programmer, an OS developer, but first of all, a good man.</p>
