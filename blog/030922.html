            <h3>The biggest problem of Pinterest (for me)</h3><p>Pinterest perhaps is one of the most popular and most used art-sharing platform, and that's a problem. What's the problem? Well, maybe the biggest one from the decade (thanks NFTs): the credits of the work.</p>If you don't know, Pinterest doesn't keep track of who posted the arwork (aka <i>pin</i>), not even tries to. If the post has something like "art made by Fulano de Tal" in the description, anyone with more fallowers can repost it without this description, culminating in a uncredited repost - unlike twitter, for example, that let you track back to the original tweet when retweeting with comment or simply better showing the original post when only retweeting. Pinterest is the best place to have work stolen, be for NFTs, for unauthorized usage, or worse (well, nothing is worse than having a piece of work minted by someone else).<p>And why do I hate it? Well, because of the same reason you should too: artists cannot be credited by their work. So many times I have searched for hours and hours on Google trying to find the original author of some picture I found on internet. Actually, in Pinterest most of the times. This is one of the reasons I now don't use it anymore. Basically all images I save nowadays are from twitter (more especifically, from the artist twitter profile) or from Devianart (that by the way doesn't allow repost, as far as I know). But still, a lot of old images I have saved when younger still have no known authors, just because when I try to search for it on Google Images and the only thing that appears to me are random citizens reposting the image with random resolutions (or even editions) on the image, without even mentioning the author (or some times removing the author signature).</p><p>Maybe the people that post their ideas on furnitures or <i>plant stuff</i> are not bad, and if you only use Pinterest to search for it, may be not that bad either. But if you are an artist like me and don't like to have your art reposted without mentioning you, you should stop using this platform too, just like me. Pack your stuff, save your favorite images, take a time to search for the author of the uncredited ones, and move on. Really.</p>
