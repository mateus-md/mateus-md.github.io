                <p>I feel different. perhaps because I figured out I'm trans, perhaps because it's a new year, perhaps it's because in a few months I start college and may end living in other city. nevertheless, I am a new person. each day I wake up different of the yesterday's me and, wow, it's been almost 4 months since my last post. in miko's time it's almost 20 years. it's a lot of time to change how we thing and see the world.</p>
                <p>I'm writing this because I grew up as an individual, and by website should reflect it. luqoo it's a _englishy_ romanization of 颅骨 (skull in mandarin). this is how I present myself to the world. the skeleton queen of my land of skulls. hope you three that read my blog like it.</p>
                <p>P.S.: if enough people ask me, I'll make my personal discord server a public server, so you guys can enter (probably you'll have to pay me to host my bot too, but let's leave it to the future)</p>
