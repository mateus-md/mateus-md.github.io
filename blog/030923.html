            <h3>explaining my free hate on webdevers</h3><p>like, every true programmer knows that most of web dev programmers are just meritocratic liberals that can be resumed in arrogance and laziness. I'll develop on that latter, but let's state that so we can start in the same page. ok? ok.</p>
<p class="dark">omg miko! why they are meritocratic liberals?</p>
<p>well, most of these young souls were eaten alive by the capitalist ideology. now they believe that working 37h a day is everything you need to be rich and successful in your life! (hope you catch the sarcasm). that's sad, but once most of them won't give up and change, let's make fun of them.</p>
<p class="dark">ok, miko. but why are they lazy and arrogant?</p>
<p>well, have you ever googled anything about Js or CSS? these madmen can't program one single line without downloading thousands of modules and libraries and frameworks because they simply don't want to program "hard things" by themselves. I got lots of issues while programming this website that when I searched in fullstack people said "dunno, but there's a function that does what you want in [insert something+Js]". and oh my devil, there are infinite amounts of frameworks. some of them with their own versions of shitty scripting language. that's just amazing! they can't unite and develop something that works together, they must recreate the wheel poorly a thousand of times -- and notice that who's saying this is the girl who invented the wheel herself a considerable amount of times. and because of these fancy shit they develop they tend to think they are the best programmers ever (ver ask a fullstack developer to write a hello world in a compiled language like C). you can google yourself the real meme of the dude trying to develop an entire Operating System in HTML.</p>
<p>oh, few. I feel much better now. ok, let's continue.</p>
<p>something that also bores me to the core is that webdevs usually don't get out of their comfort zone. they never try new things, they never try different tools, they never get out of webdev. I'm not asking them to take a job as a systems programmer or a kernel designer, I'm just saying that it doesn't hurt learn about other things related to your area. pointers and statically typed programming don't bite, you know?</p>
<p>lastly I would like to point out the development pipeline of webdevs: "o my god, this site is taking so long to load. what's the problem?" &gt; "maybe we made an inefficient code that uses a lot of resources" &gt; "nah, it's the computer is too weak. let's keep going, it's people duty to buy more potent computers".<br>I hope I don't have to develop further on that. you know that happens a lot. I'm pretty sure you know that.</p>
<p>that's it for today, I guess. see ya later! /baə baə/</p>
