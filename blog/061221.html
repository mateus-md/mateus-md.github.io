            <h3>Lowy</h3>Lowy is my programming skills' evolution pinnacle. Its an interpreter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation" target="_blank" >AOT compiled</a>, but most important <s>it's written in C</s> it's entirely from scratch. Or it will be <s>it's not that far yet</s>. No GCC, no GNU BISON, no LLVM. I want something of a chimera. A child of C, Pony, Pascal and Lua. I want something easy and embeddable like Lua, strong and useful as C, memory and type safe as Pony and Rust, and oldschool and lit as Pascal and Fortran.<p>I tried a few months ago to implement it, but I decided to put it again in the oven and let it grow a little more. I want to create a real and useful language, not like <a href="https://github.com/mateus-md/ghost" target="_blank" >Ghost</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mateus-md/Bucket-1-3" target="_blank" >Bucket</a>, but something truly useful and able to be used in real life for real problems. I want something simple but elegant. Something easy to embedding (easier than Lua) but trustable and smooth as C and Rust. Rust is too hard to me (both for learning and to implement, in the sense of being laborious), Pony is still too yong (they don't have a easy way to get user input, for example) and Pascal and Fortran are too dated. I need something new. I need Lowy.</p><p>But I still need to study a little more. Learn how programming languages work, how compilers work, and how I can put all together.</p> <p> Maybe I'll take a break to work with Lowy later, but who nows when it will get released. <s>Maybe someone can even create something in this way before me?</s>. But until I get enough knowledge to bring my child to life, I'll keep it safe in the Ideas Drawer.</p>
