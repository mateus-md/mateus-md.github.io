            <h3>the freedom of wish and the wish for freedom</h3>
            <p>the man have no control over his life or himself, no but the one is given to him, or rather, taken from him. every aware being is slaved by their own choices, that in turn are selected by the choices of others above them. limited as such, that if they had the true freedom of choice, they would only serve their own suppressed desires.</p>
            <p>of nothing is the arbitration force if their options are unique and limited. the man's choice is resumed up to what was chosen to him.  this supression of his wishes compresses his spirit and obligates him to always seek for the divine liberty that is so understood by him as is known in practice by him. the man's desire is to be free to wish, and the man's freedom is have no wishes.</p>
            <p>as in a market, the variety of items to be purchased are predefined and limited; chosen by other forces. but the man is taught to believe that he is free to choose one of the already chosen options. and, in his heart, he already knows that has no such thing as free will - and therefore wishes so hard to have it. the eternal seek for freedom leads to the momentary joy of expanding the possibilities, but is rapidly omitted and overtaken once again by the reanimated wish of more freedom. the eternal return, so many times described by the <i>wisemans</i> of older times.</p>
            <p>the man is uniquely free to be enslaved by his own will.</p>
