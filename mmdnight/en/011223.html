            <h3>my cocoon</h3>
<p>my body. I thought it was a prison. that my external edge of what my being represents and presents to others was enclosing me. but it wasn't. my body is not a cage for my true form, it's a cocoon.</p>
<p>
just like a little caterpillar, I grew up to a point where I'm locked in place, but because I must change. from the raw material of my body I'll rise as a new being. I'm been eaten alive -- and that's quite painful -- but I won't die. I'm safe within my cocoon and, pretty soon, I'll be strong enough to break free. not from my old body, but from my old self. I'm completely being renewed.</p><p>
sooner or later, I'll become a butterfly, or perhaps a moth, or even something else, but I'll evolve. I'll become something new, something grown from who I was. I'm not in a cage, I'm in a metamorphosis phase. for now, I'll be vulnerable and weak, but, at the end, I'll be unstoppable. I'll be beautiful. and no one can stop me from getting out of this cocoon.</p>
